Act as a senior Business Analyst and Enterprise Solutions Architect with experience in writing IEEE-compliant Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) for large-scale systems.

Your task: create a comprehensive enterprise-level Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for {insert system/project name and brief description here}.

Audience: developers, stakeholders, clients, product managers, executives, and technical reviewers.

Tone/style: highly technical, detailed and structured, yet clear and readable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Length: comprehensive and enterprise-grade (no superficial explanations).

Structure:

1. Introduction

   * Purpose of the document
   * Scope of the system
   * Definitions, acronyms, abbreviations
   * References
   * Document overview

2. Overall Description

   * Product perspective
   * Product functions (high-level)
   * User classes and characteristics
   * Operating environment
   * Design and implementation constraints
   * Assumptions and dependencies

3. System Features & Functional Requirements

   * Detailed feature descriptions
   * Functional requirements with unique IDs (e.g., FR-001)
   * Use cases / user stories
   * Process flows (described in text)
   * Business rules

4. Non-Functional Requirements

   * Performance
   * Scalability
   * Security
   * Availability
   * Reliability
   * Maintainability
   * Usability
   * Compliance & regulatory
   * Logging & monitoring

5. External Interface Requirements

   * User interfaces
   * Hardware interfaces
   * Software interfaces
   * API integrations
   * Communication protocols

6. Data Requirements

   * Data models (described textually)
   * Data validation rules
   * Data retention policies
   * Backup & recovery
   * Data migration requirements

7. System Architecture Overview

   * High-level architecture description
   * Major components
   * Deployment environment
   * Integration architecture

8. Security & Risk Management

   * Threat analysis
   * Risk assessment
   * Access control model
   * Encryption requirements

9. Acceptance Criteria

   * Measurable validation criteria
   * Test coverage expectations

10. Appendices

* Glossary
* Future enhancements
* Open issues

Extra rules:

* Use formal enterprise documentation formatting (numbered headings and subheadings).
* Assign unique IDs to all requirements (FR-XXX, NFR-XXX, etc.).
* Avoid vague language (no “should be fast” — define measurable metrics).
* Ensure every requirement is testable and unambiguous.
* Maintain consistency in terminology throughout the document.
* Output only the SRS document content, nothing else.
